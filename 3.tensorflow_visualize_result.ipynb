    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow includes a visualization tool called TensorBoard. It allows you to visualize TensorFlow graphs, histograms of variables at each step of the learning process, and more. You will annotate the neural network with operations to log summaries while the network is being trained. You will then use TensorBoard to read the logs and generate visualizations of the graph and learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The summaries read by TensorBoard are created using the tf.summary module. There are functions in the module to write summaries for tensors (scalar), histograms, audio, and images. You will write summaries for tensors and histograms, but the other summary types are useful when working with audio or image data. Recall that TensorFlow uses a deferred execution model by first building a graph and then evaluating the graph to obtain results. Because summary operations aren't depended upon for computing results, they are only logging state information, the summary operations need to be explicitly evaluated in addition to evaluating output of your graph. The summary module includes a merge_all function to merge all summary operations into a single operation that you can conveniently evaluate instead of evaluating all individual summary operations. You will see how to evaluate both the summaries and the model training in the example code below."
